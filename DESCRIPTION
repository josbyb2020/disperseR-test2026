Description: disperseR is a restructured version of the hyspdisp package. 
    It is an R package that runs HYSPLIT many times and calculates the HYSPLIT 
    Average Dispersion (or HyADS) exposure metric. The results can then be 
    aggregated to ZIP code level to create national estimates of exposure from 
    various sources. For example, plumes from several power plants can be tracked 
    for many days and cumulative impacts estimated. The package uses code borrowed 
    from the SplitR package in a slightly modified version.
    Version 0.2.0 has been updated to remove dependencies on retired packages 
    (rgeos, rgdal, maptools) and uses modern spatial libraries (sf, terra).
