\title{Kill orphaned HYSPLIT processes}
\usage{
cleanup_hysplit_zombies(verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical. Print information about killed processes. Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the number of processes killed.
}
\description{
Finds and terminates any running HYSPLIT processes (hyts_std,
hycs_std, parhplot) that may be left over from crashed runs. On Windows,
these can hold file locks and prevent subsequent runs.
}
\details{
On Windows, if an R worker crashes while HYSPLIT is running, the HYSPLIT
process may become orphaned and continue running, holding locks on output
files. This function identifies and terminates such processes.

On Unix/macOS, orphaned processes are less common due to process group
handling, but this function works cross-platform.
