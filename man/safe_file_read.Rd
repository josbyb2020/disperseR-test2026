\usage{
safe_file_read(
  path,
  read_fn = readLines,
  max_retries = 5L,
  delay_ms = 200L,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. Path to file.}

\item{read_fn}{Function. The read function to use (e.g., readLines, fst::read_fst).}

\item{max_retries}{Integer. Maximum retry attempts. Default 5.}

\item{delay_ms}{Integer. Delay between retries in milliseconds. Default 200.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to read_fn.}
}
\value{
Result of read_fn(path, ...) on success, or stops with error.
}
\description{
Attempts to read a file with retries to handle Windows file
locking delays. Useful when reading HYSPLIT output immediately after
the process completes.
